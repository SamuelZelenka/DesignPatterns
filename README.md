# DesignPatterns
Samuel Zelenka af Rol√©n

A slimmed down version of the magicka spell system where you combine elements to create spells. 

Elements are selected using the number keys 1-4 and can be reset with space.
To cast a spell with the current configuration of elements use left-click

to move the capsule(player) around right click in the scene

The goal was to be able to implement a system that could easily make an object from a given configuration that is easily expandable. 

-------------------

## Singleton:

###### SpellPool.cs
The object pool for spells is a singleton as only one instance of the pool is required to acquire spell objects and also neatly keep them under the same transform in the scene hierarchy.
This also allow the easy access to the prefab variable which can be assigned in the inspector.    

-------------------

## Factory Pattern:

###### SpellFactory.cs:
	Creates a SpellObject from specific parameters. 

-------------------

## Strategy Pattern:

###### Spell.cs / EarthThrow.cs / FireBall.cs / DefaultSpell.cs / WaterSplash.cs / WindGust.cs:
	Spell contains a set of abstract and virtual properties and methods that are overriden in child classes
	to allow flexbility in the behaviour of each derived class.


-------------------

## Command Pattern:

###### InputAction.cs / CastSpellAction.cs / MoveToPointAction.cs / ResetElementAction.cs / SelectElementAction.cs:
	InputAction encapsulate the needed methods to be able to perform certain Actions at runtime.
	in this case all calls happen within PlayerInput.cs Update method as the command is executed upon input in real time. 
	
	
(Also see PlayerInput.cs for initialization of the inputs)

-------------------


## Object pool

###### GameObjectPool.cs / ObjectPool.cs / IPoolable.cs

The object pool is a generic object pool written to be able to use any kind of class.
To be able to create/destroy gameobjects in unity properly I've had to make a derived class called GameObjectPool.cs to utilize the instantiate() / Destroy() methods

I've introduced a capacity to allow the pool to max out on stored inactive objects to free up on memory after an eventual spike in the number of game objects.
I also allowed the option to prewarm the object pool if the game for some reason would halt mid game due to instantiation of too many new objects.
